# Investigating the epidemiological and economic effects of a third-party certification for restaurants and bars with COVID-19 prevention measures

## About this repository
We publish the dataã€€and codes for analyses of the policy effects of the Yamanashi Green Zone Certification System, which was implemented as a countermeasure against new coronavirus infections in Yamanashi Prefecture since July 2020. The effects to be verified are (1) economic effects (increase or decrease in sales and number of customers per restaurant) and (2) infection control effects (increase or decrease in the number of new cases of novel coronavirus infection) resulting from the spread of the Green Zone Certification in restaurants and bars in Yamanashi Prefecture.
