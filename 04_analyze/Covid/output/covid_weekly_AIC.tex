The dependent variable is the log-transformed value of the number of new infection cases. 
The unit of analysis is prefecture and week, and the fixed effects are introduced in all models. 
For the observations, six prefectures are targeted.
The values in parentheses are cluster-robust standard errors. Clustering is at the prefecture level.
The following variables are included as covariates: Infectious(log), Susceptible(log), State of Emergency dummy, Tests(log), Customers per restaurant(log), 
Average temperature(log), Average rainfall(log), School closure dummy, Gathering restriction dummy.
Cumulative GZ-certified restaurants, log is the log-transformed value of the number of cumulative certified-GZ restaurants.
Infectious(log) is the log-transformed value of the number of potentially infected people.
Susceptible(log) is the log-transformed value of the total number of susceptible population.
State of Emergency is the dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the state of emergency is declared. 
Tests(log) is the log-transformed value of the number of COVID-19 tests.
Customers per restaurant(log) is the log-transformed value of the number of customers per restaurant.
Average temperature(log) is the log-transformed value of the mean temperature (Fahrenheit degrees).
Average rainfall(log) is the log-transformed value of the aggregated rainfall (in millimeters).
School closure is the dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the school closure is declared. 
Gathering restriction is the dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the large-scale gathering restriction is declared.
For the variables that take absolute value 0 (New infection cases(log), Cumulative GZ-certified restaurants, log, Infectious(log), and Tests(log)), we add value 1 before log-transforming to avoid the logarithm of 0.}} \\
