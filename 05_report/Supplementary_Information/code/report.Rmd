# A.   Data

Our data used for control variables (A.1 - A.4) in the main analyses (D.1, D.3) and dependent variables (A.5 - A.8) in the robustness check (D.4-D.7) come from multiple sources. 

## A.1  COVID-19 policy dummy variables
For the emergency declaration dummy variable, we use data on the progress of the government's response as summarized by Tottori Prefecture on its website for new COVID-19 infections. The site lists the prefectures that are subject to the issuance, change, and cancellation of emergency declarations in chronological order. Based on this information, we determined whether each prefecture was under a state of emergency declaration at a certain time. 
For the school closure dummy variable,  we use data on information of school closures for the national government and each prefecture in the time-series news archives on NHK's special website for COVID-19. The variable was set to be 1 only when schools are closed in the entire prefecture. For municipality or school-level closure, the variable is set to be 0.
The gathering restriction dummy variable is created based on the governor's press conferences and updates on COVID-19 in each prefecture. The variable takes a value of one if there is a restriction on event capacity of 5,000 people or less and a capacity ratio of 50% or less in each prefecture, and takes a value of zero if either of these criteria is not met. In cases where the prefectural criteria are based on the guidelines of the respective industry, the dummies are created based on the common guidelines of event-related industries. 

## A.2  COVID-19 test cases
In the analysis of the infection prevention effect, we use the data on the number of COVID-19 test cases published by each prefecture. As of 2020, the number of tests in each prefecture varies greatly in Japan, particularly because of varying capacities for conducting tests across prefectures. If the number of tests itself is small, the number of new infection cases may be underestimated. 

## A.3　Weather data
For the weather data of temperature and precipitation, we use the daily weather observation data of observatories in each prefecture using the "Past Weather Data Search" of the Japan Meteorological Agency. The average rainfall and the average temperature are used as the representative values. When extracting the data from the database, several municipalities with observatories are chosen from several municipalities with the top population. In detail, Yamanashi Prefecture is represented by Kofu and Kawaguchiko; Nagano Prefecture by Nagano, Matsumoto, Ueda, and Iida; Shizuoka Prefecture by Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, and Fuji; Gunma Prefecture by Maebashi and Isesaki; Ibaraki Prefecture by Tsukuba, Mito, and Hitachi; and Tochigi Prefecture by Utsunomiya and Oyama. The weather data for each prefecture is the average of the data for the municipalities belonging to each prefecture.  

## A.4  Human mobility inflow and outflow by prefecture
We use Agoop's paid data for the human flow within each prefecture and the human flow from outside the prefecture into each prefecture. The data is drawn from users' GPS information held by Agoop. It is the data that calculates the entire human flow from a sample of the number of people who existed at a certain coordinate at a certain time. The data provides information on not only the total number of people in a prefecture, but also the movement of people from a specific prefecture to a specific prefecture/municipality. This data is used to estimate the number of potentially infectious mobility coming from other prefectures as shown in the susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) model, rather than as an objective variable.

## A.5  Restaurant information views online
We also use data on the rate of increase in the number of restaurant information views online per week, which is available on V-RESAS published by the Cabinet Office of Japan. The rate of increase or decrease in the restaurant information views online compared to the same week in 2019 is disclosed for each prefecture. The original data is held by Retty Inc., which operates Japan's largest word-of-mouth gourmet service. This data is used as the dependent variable in the robustness check (D.4 Restaurant information views online)

## A.6  Human mobility by facility type 
For the mobility data, we also use the “COVID-19: Community Mobility Report” published by Google. The data reveals the rate of increase or decrease in human flow in six types of locations ("retail and recreation," "grocery and pharmacy," "parks," "transit stations," "workplaces," and "residential") by country and region/prefecture. The median value for each day of the week for the five-week period from January 3 to February 6, 2020 is used as the baseline for the rate of change. Thus, the daily data is the rate of change from the base values for each day of the week.This data is used as the dependent variable in the robustness check (D.5 Human mobility by facility type)

## A.7  Human mobility across regions 
We also used human flow data on the rate of increase or decrease in the mobility by region (intracity, intercity, and interprefectural), compared to the same week in 2019 for each prefecture. This data is available on V-RESAS. This data is used as the dependent variable in the robustness check (D.6 Inter-regional Mobility) to examine the impact on human flow in and across the prefectures. 

## A.8　Stay-home rate
We use the data on stay-home rate, which the Mizuno Laboratory of the National Institute of Informatics and the Graduate University for Advanced Studies publish. The data is collected by age group and time, based on the population data estimated in real-time from the information of about 78 million base stations of DOCOMO, a major Japanese telecommunication company. They define the number of people going out from residential areas as 
$$The\ number\ of\ people\ going\ out =daytime\ population - nighttime\ population$$
and
$$The\ Stay-home\ rate $$
$$ = \displaystyle 1-\frac{Number\ of\ people\ who\ go\ out\ from\ 9:00\ to\ 18:00\ on\ a\ given\ day * average\ time\ spent\ out}{Number\ of\ people\ who\ go\ out\ from\ 9:00\ to\ 18:00\ on\ a\ normal\ day * average\ time\ spent\ out}$$
This data is used in the robustness check (D.8 Stay-home rate).

# B   Estimation equation 
The epidemiological analyses are based on the SIR-applied fixed effect model. This section shows the process of how the equation ((1) in Methods in the main article) is derived from the SIR model. 

The SIR model captures the epidemic dynamics of infectious diseases that spread directly from person to person. The model estimates the infection status in three stages: Susceptible, Infectious, and Removed. Susceptible refers to the state of being susceptible to infection, Infectious refers to the state of being infected, and Removed refers to the state of having recovered or gained immunity or having died.

$$\frac{dI(t)}{dt}=\beta S(t)I(t)-\gamma I(t)$$

$\beta$ denotes infectivity, and $\gamma$ denotes recovery or isolation rate. In other words, the rate of change of the Infectious population is dependent on the interactions between the Susceptible and Infectious populations, the infectivity of the virus, and the rate at which the Infectious move to the Removed population. We can obtain an expression for the number of new COVID-19 cases in a given time period by rewriting the ordinary differential equation as:

$$COVID = \beta SI$$

Taking logarithms on both sides, we get:

$$ln(COVID) =ln\beta + lnS + lnI$$

A previous study has shown that the model that assumes that the proportion of susceptible people who can be infected and the proportion of infectious people who can infect others are not equal to one, but vary depending on the situation, can more accurately estimate the number of newly infected people (Law, K.B., Peariasamy, K.M., Gill, B.S. et al 2020). Therefore, we transform the model by adding coefficients to the Susceptible and Infectious variables as follows

$$ln(COVID) = ln\beta + \delta_2 lnS + \delta_3 lnI$$

In order to adapt this basic estimation equation to changes in external circumstances that affect the infection cases, we add control variables such as economic activity variables and weather conditions. In addition, the purpose of the GZ certification policy that we want to estimate is to reduce the infectivity ($\beta$) that can be transferred from one infected person to another. Therefore, we redefine the infectivity ($\beta$) as follows to derive the main estimation model.
$$ln\beta= \alpha_1lnGZ + u $$
$$ln(COVID) = \alpha_1lnGZ + \delta_2lnS + \delta_3lnI + \delta_4ln Control +u$$
